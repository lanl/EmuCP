Description: EmuCP implements the Emulating the Conditional Posterior (ECP) algorithm. This algorithm uses improves on the multiple imputation approch for sampling from the cut distribution by emulating the parameters of a parametric approximation to the conditional posterior. The emulator is used to extend the multiple imputation algorithm to many more imputations for the same computational budget.
